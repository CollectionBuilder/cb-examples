## CollectionBuilder 

<https://collectionbuilder.github.io/>

CollectionBuilder is a project of University of Idaho Library's [Digital Initiatives](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and the [Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning](https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} (CDIL) following the [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} methodology. 
Powered by the open source static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and a modern static web stack, it puts collection metadata to work building beautiful sites.

The basic theme is created using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
Metadata visualizations are built using open source libraries such as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/), [Leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/), [Spotlight gallery](https://github.com/nextapps-de/spotlight){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and [Lunr.js](https://lunrjs.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
Object metadata is exposed using [Schema.org](http://schema.org){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Open Graph protocol](http://ogp.me/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} standards.
